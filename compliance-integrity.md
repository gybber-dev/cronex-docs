Code of Conduct:

## Living & Communicating Integrity and Setting Clear Rules

As a licensed cryptocurrency exchange service, we have put in place a set of regulations related to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT). Our internal rules are clear and designed to allow us to work efficiently while minimizing business risks. Adherence to legal regulations, our internal rules, Code of Conduct, and internal guidelines form the foundation of our daily operations and are essential tools in realizing our goals and vision.

At the company level, we have established a set of rules and values that we must all abide by and that make up our code of conduct. However, rules and principles can only go so far in defining how we behave. That's why we've added something more, something that transcends everything else and represents our overall business approach: integrity. Integrity is how we act and work, and how we interpret situations, especially ones that are not covered by rules. This is a matter of corporate culture. It's not just about what we do, but also how we do it. Achieving goals at any cost is not acceptable in our environment. We operate based on ethical standards and everything we do is evaluated in the light of integrity.

Although we can only monitor and supervise our internal operations, we are aware of external factors, such as unfair or fraudulent conduct by third parties, that can harm our clients. To address this, we have allocated significant resources to fraud prevention and established an internal section dedicated to this effort. Although we have limited control over external factors, we are committed to preventing fraud and will never stop working towards this goal. It's part of our commitment to integrity. More information on our Code of Conduct is available.
