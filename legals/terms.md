Special note: Risks of trading virtual assets
---------------------------------------------

Any kind of trading of virtual assets and virtual currencies involves significant risk. The value of virtual assets / currencies has high volatility (value can increase and decrease significantly in a very short period of time and at any given moment). Such price fluctuations bring uncertainty. The value of a virtual currency and collapse in demand may be influenced by many factors, including irrational (or rational) bubbles, loss of confidence in the virtual currency, changes in software development, government decisions, creation of a competitive currency, technical problems, political or non-political statements, statements of influencers and news and hacker-attacks. Your virtual assets may be lost by losing your password or other security codes.

There are also other potential risks that may not be foreseen in these Terms. Virtual currencies have special risks that are not generally shared with the official currencies, because they are not issued by governments, or with commodities or goods that are tangible or registered in the official registry. Virtual currencies are intangible, decentralized, digital assets, backed by technology and trust. No central bank or other institution can take any measures to protect the value of virtual currency. Virtual currencies (hereinafter also crypto currencies) are an autonomous and largely unregulated system of firms and individuals issuing currencies. The risk of loss in trading, buying, selling or holding virtual assets / currencies can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading in virtual assets / currency or any levered or derivative virtual assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. Be careful to keep your private keys, passwords, security codes and words for yourself and change them on a regular basis.

CRONEX uses payment providers for transfers of fiat money for rendering exchange services and operating with the fiat money, whereas assisting banks do not, by any means, represent a medium of exchange, transfer, withdrawal, deposit or other transaction in connection to virtual currencies.

CRONEX shall not ask you for any password or private key, nor shall we ask users to transmit any funds, Bitcoins or other virtual currency to our bank account, Bitcoin address, Ethereum address or other addresses, which are not listed on the trading platform. Please do not trust any discount or promotion related information. CRONEX shall not be responsible for any losses caused by transmitting funds from/to bank accounts, or virtual funds to any addresses that are not listed or given to you on the trading platform. Take care of always accessing CRONEX website through link [https://cronex.io/](https://cronex.io/) and CRONEX exchange through the link: [https://cronex.io/login](https://cronex.io/login). In case of uncertainty or suspicious link is given on forums or received by a suspicious account, user or website, please contact our support immediately and do not transfer any fiat or virtual money to such suspicious links or accounts. In case of uncertainty, always type the website [https://cronex.io](https://cronex.io) or [https://cronex.io/login](https://cronex.io/login) into browser yourself.

For the avoidance of doubt, we do not provide and will never provide any investment advice in connection with the Services described in these Terms of Use either by ourselves or through third parties. Please consider any cooperation with companies that (allegedly) offer financial services as the most risky business and make sure you inspect the alleged financial service provider most carefully. Any decision to purchase or sell virtual assets is solely your decision and we shall not be liable for any loss suffered. Please note that after you transfer the virtual assets to a certain virtual assets wallet account such transfer cannot be revoked and we do not accept any responsibility for your actions.

Description of services and trading limitations
-----------------------------------------------

The exchange services, operated by CRONEX, allow users to buy, sell and store virtual currencies such as but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP and other tokens and coins that are carefully selected by CRONEX. Our exchange does not offer any coins or tokens that are or might be considered as securities. CRONEX services also allow all registered users to:

*   Buy/exchange virtual currency for virtual currency;
*   Buy/exchange virtual currency for fiat money;
*   Transfer virtual currencies to other CRONEX wallet addresses or other third party wallet addresses; PLEASE NOTE: In the process of listing new currencies, CRONEX is following its internal procedures and safety requirements. Therefore, some of the currencies may at the beginning only have a buy and sell option, without an option to transfer the currency to another CRONEX wallet or other third party wallet addresses. Users will be notified about this before placing a buy/sell order and will have to agree with it beforehand.
*   Storing virtual currencies in the CRONEX virtual currency wallet.

### Virtual currency-to-virtual currency exchange

For Virtual Currency-to-Virtual Currency transactions we do not charge fees. The Virtual-to-Virtual Currency exchange service is enabled for the exchange of any virtual currency available on Cronex platform in pair with one of the following virtual currencies ETH, BTC and USDT (virtual currency pair trading). The exchange value will be seen when placing an order, however the user hereby explicitly agrees the final exchange value will be seen after the order shall be processed due to the time difference in transfer execution during which the value of virtual currency may change.

### Fiat-to-virtual currency exchange

All prices on the CRONEX platform are shown in EUR and USD.

CRONEX reserves the right to add other conversion fiat currencies for purchasing virtual currencies in the future. CRONEX also reserves the right to remove any of exchanging pairs in the future.

### Payment methods

CRONEX uses payment providers for transfers of fiat money for rendering exchange services and operating with the fiat money. Payment providers offers users to buy virtual currencies with SEPA/SWIFT transfers, credit cards (Visa and MasterCard).

USERS who use credit cards or other payment methods other than SEPA transfer, will be able to make a purchase in their own currency. In the course of the transaction, the conversion into EUR currency shall be automatically made by the payment processor (not CRONEX); the conversion rate can bring an additional cost onto the user.

### Deposit and withdrawal limitations

You may request a withdrawal of your virtual assets of fiat equivalent of such assets, subject to the limitations as stated in the Terms.

The amount of funds for payments and withdrawals of fiat money are limited per day and per month. For the purpose of purchasing virtual currency a user may be subject to a maximum daily deposit and maximum monthly deposit limitation based on internal AML and CFT rules, whereas a user can see its daily and monthly limitation in Cronex platform application. In case a user exceeds the set limits, additional inquiry with regard to AML and CTF prevention measures shall be taken (source of funds inquiry etc.) in order to proceed with the transfer or the funds are processed next business day or month. In case additional internal due diligence checks are not successfully implemented by the user the excess funds will be automatically returned to the user’s bank account from which the user has made SEPA payment. When using a credit card user is limited to the maximum deposit, higher deposits will not be available (they will be technically prevented). The limitation applies to natural persons. This is a precautionary measure for AML/CTF purposes. The amount of deposited, traded, transferred or withheld virtual currency per day and month is not limited.
