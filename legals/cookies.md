Types of cookies
----------------

There are two types of cookies depending on their lifetime:

*   **Session cookies** — these allow us to link your actions during a particular session. These expire each time you close the Website and do not remain on your device afterwards.
*   **Persistent cookies** — these are stored on your device in between sessions. These allow your preferences or actions to be remembered. These will remain on your device until they expire, or you delete them from your cache.

By domain, there are first-party and third-party cookies:

*   **First-party cookies** are set by the domain pertaining to our Website; and
*   **Third-party cookies** are stored by a different domain to the Website’s domain.

The cookies placed on your device fall into the following categories by their purpose:

*   **Strictly necessary cookies** — these cookies are essential for the operation of the Website and for you to use its features. For example, we may use these cookies to ensure fraud prevention or help you log in to our Website and fill in forms more easily. We also use these types of cookies to ensure that our Website is displayed correctly on your device. Without these cookies, services you have asked for may not be provided.
*   **Functional cookies** — these cookies enable the Website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
*   **Analytical/Performance cookies** — these cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. All information collected by these cookies is only used to improve how our Website works.
*   **Targeting cookies** — these cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They may be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the Website operator’s permission, and the information collected may be used, for example, to provide measurement services or target ads.
