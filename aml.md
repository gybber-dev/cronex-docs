PRINCIPLES FOR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY
------------------------------------------------------

The organizational structure of the Company must correspond to its size and the nature, scope, and level of complexity of its activities and services provided, including the risk appetite and related risks, and must be structured in accordance with the principle of three lines of defense. The organizational structure of the Company must correspond to the complete understanding of potential risks and their management. There porting and subordination chains of the Company must be ensured in such a way that all Employees know their place in the organizational structure and know their work duties.

Chief Executive Officer

The Chief Executive Officer (further in this document - CEO) is the carrier of the culture of compliance with the requirements of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing prevention, guaranteeing that Employees of the Company operate in an environment where they are fully aware of the requirements for the prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and the obligations associated with these requirements, and the relevant risk considerations are taken into account to a suitable extent in the decision-making processes of the Company. The CEO bears ultimate responsibility for the measures taken to prevent the use of the Company’s services for Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing. They provide oversight and are accountable for:

*   Establishing and maintaining AML processes, procedures, risk, and control processes
*   Adopting these Guidelines and other internal guidelines and instructions
*   Determining the Company’s Guidelines for AML measures
*   Appointing an MLRO and ensuring that the MLRO has the powers, resources and expertise required to perform their assignment
*   Allocating sufficient resources to ensure the effective implementation of the Guidelines and other related documents and to maintain the organization;
*   Ensuring all relevant Employees complete annual AML training

The first line of defense — the Employees

The first line of defense has the function of applying the due diligence measures upon Business Relationship and Occasional Transactions and applying due diligence measures during the Business Relationship. First line of defense comprises the structural units and Employees of the Company with whose activities risks are associated and that must identify and assess these risks, their specific features and scope and that manage these risks by way of their ordinary activities, primarily by way of application of due diligence measures. The risks arising from the activities of and provision of services by the Company belong to the first line of defense. They are the managers (owners) of these risks and responsible for them. The Employees of the Company must act with the foresight and competence expected from them and according to the requirements set for their positions, proceeding from the interests and the goals of the Company, and ensure that the country's financial system and economic space are not used for Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. The Company takes measures to assess the suitability of the Employees before they start working with the relevant training. For the aforementioned reasons, the Employees are required to:

*   Adhere to all requirements outlined in the Guidelines and other related documents;
*   collect required Customer information in accordance with their function and account abilities; • report information, situations, activities, transactions or attempted transactions that are unusual for any type of service or Customer relationship, regardless of the amount, whether or not the transaction was completed without delay to the MLRO
*   Not inform or otherwise make Customers aware if the Customer or any other Customers are or may be the subject of a report or if a report has been or may be filed;
*   Complete the appropriate AML training required for the Employee’s position.

The second line of defense – Risk Management and Compliance, MLRO

The second line of defense consists of the risk management and compliance functions. These functions may also be performed by the same person or structural unit depending on the size of the Company and the nature, scope and level of complexity of their activities and provided services, incl. the risk appetite and risks arising from activities of the Company. The objective of the compliance function is to guarantee that the Company complies with effective legislation, guidelines and other documents and to assess the possible effect of any changes in the legal or regulative environment on the activities of the Company and on the compliance framework. The task of compliance is to help the first line of defense as the owners of risk to define the places where risks manifest themselves (e.g., analysis of suspicious and unusual transactions, for which compliance Employees have the required professional skills, personal qualities, etc.) and to help the first line of defense manage these risks efficiently. The second line of defense does not engage in taking risks. Risk policy is implemented, and the risk management framework is controlled by the risk management function. The performer of the risk management function ensures that all risks are identified, assessed, measured, monitored, and managed, and informs the appropriate units of the Company about them. The performer of the risk management function for the purposes of AML primarily performs the supervision over adherence to risk appetite, supervision over risk tolerance, supervision over identification of changes in risks, performs the overview of associated risks, and performs other duties related to risk management. The CEO has appointed a MLRO for performing the second line of defense functions. This person is not operationally involved in the areas that the MLRO will be monitoring and verifying and is thus independent in relation to these. The MLRO is accountable for the following activities:

*   produce and, when necessary, update the Company’s Guidelines;
*   monitor and verify on an ongoing basis that the Company is fulfilling the requirements prescribed by these Guidelines and related documents and according to external laws and regulations;
*   provide the Company’s staff and members of the CEO with advice and support regarding the rules relating to Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing;
*   inform and train the members of the CEO and relevant persons about the rules relating to Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing;
*   investigate and register sufficient data on received internal notifications and decide whether the activity canbe justified or whether it is suspicious;
*   file the relevant reports with the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable legislation; • check and regularly assess whether the Company’s procedures and guidelines to prevent the use of the business for Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing are fit for purpose and effective;

The MLRO reports to the CEO quarterly. This report must be in writing and include at least the following items:

*   number of Customers under all risk classifications
*   number of hits of persons in relation to the Sanctions lists and applied measures;
*   number of Customers or Customers’ representatives identified as PEPs or persons with a connection to a PEP;
*   number of internal notifications on suspicious activity or transactions;
*   number of the relevant reports reported to the Financial Crime Investigation Service (FCIS);
*    number and content of a request for information from the FCIS within the framework of an investigation;
*   confirmation that the Company’s risk assessment for Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is up to date;
*   confirmation that these Guidelines and other related documents are up to date;
*   confirmation that the staffing in respect of AML measures is sufficient;
*   all inadequacies (if any) identified by control function have been addressed;
*   list of obligatory trainings which have been held for the staff in respect of AML measures.

The third line of defense — Internal Audit

The third line of defense is comprised by the independent and effective internal audit function. The internal audit function may be performed by one or several Employees, the Company's structural unit with the relevant functions or by the third party, which provides the relevant service to the Company. The Employees, the Company's structural unit or third party, which performs the internal audit function must have the required competency, tools, and access to the relevant information in all structural units of the Company. The internal audit methods must comply with the size of the Company, the nature, scope, and level of complexity of the activities and provided services, incl. the risk appetite and risks arising from activities of the Company. The decision to conduct an internal audit is made by a resolution of the CEO. The CEO must assess the need to conduct an internal audit at least annually.

PRINCIPLES OF CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE MEASURES IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Customer due diligence (CDD) measures are required for verifying the identity of a new or existing Customer as a well-performing risk-based ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship with the Customer. The CDD measures consist of 3 levels, including simplified and enhanced due diligence measures, as specified below. Main Principles The CDD measures are taken and performed to the extent necessary considering the Customer’s risk profile and other circumstances in the following cases:

*   upon establishment of the Business Relationship and during the ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship;
*   upon executing or mediating of Occasional Transaction(s) outside the Business Relationship, where the value of the transaction(s) amounts to 700 euros or more (or an equal amount in another assets) within 24 hours;
*   upon verification of information gathered while applying due diligence measures or in the case of doubts as to the sufficiency or truthfulness of the documents or data gathered earlier while updating the relevant data;
*   upon suspicion of Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing, regardless of any derogations, exceptions or limits provided for in these Guidelines and applicable legislation.

The Company does not establish or maintain the Business Relationship and does not perform the transaction if:

*   the Company is not able to take and perform any of required CDD measures;
*   the Company has any suspicions that the Company’s services or transaction will be used for Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing;
*   the risk level of the Customer or of the transaction does not comply with the Company's risk appetite.

In the case of receiving information in foreign languages within the framework of CDD implementation, the Company may request to demand translation of the documents to another language applicable for the Company. The use of translations should be avoided in situations where the original documents are prepared in a language applicable for the Company. Achieving CDD is a process that starts with the implementation of CDD measures. When that process is complete, the Customer is assigned documented individual risk level which shall form the basis for follow-up measures, and which is followed up and updated when necessary. The Company has applied CDD measures adequately if the Company has the inner conviction that they have complied with the obligation to apply due diligence measures. The principle of reasonability is observed in the consideration of inner conviction. This means that the Company must, upon the application of CDD measures, acquire the knowledge, understanding and assertation that they have collected enough information about the Customer, the Customer’s activities, the purpose of the Business

Relationship and of the transactions carried out within the scope of the Business Relationship, the origin of the funds, etc., so that they understand the Customer and the Customer’s (business) activities, thereby taking into account the Customer’s risk level, the risk associated with the Business Relationship and the nature of such relationship. Such a level of assertation must make it possible to identify complicated, high- value and unusual transactions and transaction patterns that have no reasonable or obvious economic or legitimate purpose or are uncharacteristic of the specific features of the business in question.

The Services Provided

The Company's main economic activity is the Virtual Currency services. For this reason, the Company offers to their Customers the following transaction types:

*   providing Custodian Virtual Currency Wallet operator service, which allows to the Customer open Custodian Virtual Currency Wallet on the Customer's name and make transactions with this wallet: to deposit Virtual Currency and to withdraw deposited Virtual Currency to another wallet(s);
*   providing Virtual Currency exchange operator service, which allows the Customer to exchange, purchase and sell Virtual Currency.

The Company provides aforementioned services only for the following Virtual Currencies:

*   Bitcoin — BTC
*   Ethereum — ETH
*   etc.

The Verification of Information used for the Customer's Identification Verification of the information for the Customer's identification means using data from a reliable and independent source to confirm that the data is true and correct, also confirming, if necessary, that the data directly related to the Customer is true and correct. This, inter alia, means that the purpose of verification of information is to obtain reassurance that the Customer, who wants to establish the Business Relationship is the person they claim to be. The reliable and independent source (must exist cumulatively) is verification of the information obtained in the course of identification:

*   which originates from two different sources;
*   which has been issued by (identity documents) or received from a third party or a place that has no interest in or connections with the Customer or the Company, i.e. that is neutral (e.g. information obtained from the Internet is not such information, as it often originates from the Customer themselves or its reliability and independence cannot be verified);
*   the reliability and independence of which can be determined without objective obstacles and reliability and independence are also understandable to a third party not involved in the Business Relationship; and • the data included in which or obtained via which are up to date and relevant and the Company can obtain reassurance about this (and reassurance can in certain cases also be obtained on the basis of the two previous clauses).

Application of Simplified Due Diligence Measures (level 1)

 Simplified due diligence (SDD) measures are applied where the Customer’s risk profile indicates low risk level of ML/TF. When applying SDD measures, the Company must only obtain the following data of the Customer who is a natural person:

*   name(s) and surname(s);
*   personal number; or in case of the Customer, which is a legal entity, the following data
*   business name or name;
*   legal form;
*    registration number, if such number has been issued;
*   head office (address) and address of actual operation;
*   the Customer´s representative name(s), surname(s) and personal number or date of birth; and ensure that the first payment be carried out through an account with a credit institution, where the credit institution is registered in EEA or in a Third Country which imposes requirements equivalent to those laid down in the relevant law and is supervised by competent authorities for compliance with those requirements.

SDD measures may be carried out only where the ongoing monitoring of the Customer’s Business Relationship is performed in accordance with the Guidelines and there is a possibility to identify suspicious Monetary Operations and transactions. SDD measures must not be carried out in the circumstances where enhanced due diligence measures (as described below) must be carried out. Where, in the course of performing ongoing monitoring of the Customer’s Business Relationships, it is established that the risk of ML and/or TF is no longer low, the Company must apply the relevant level of CDD measures.

Application of Standard Due Diligence Measures (level 2)

Standard due diligence measures are applied to all Customers where CDD measures must be applied in accordance with the Guidelines. The following standard due diligence measures should be applied:

*    identification of the Customer and verification of the submitted information based on information obtained from a reliable and independent source;
*   identification and verification of a representative of the Customer and their right of representation; • identification of the Beneficial Owner and, for the purpose of verifying their identity, taking measures to the extent that allows the Company to make certain that it knows who the Beneficial Owner is, and understands the ownership and control structure of the Customer;
*   understanding of Business Relationship, transaction or operation and, where relevant, gathering information thereon;
*    gathering information on whether the Customer is PEP, their family member or a person known to be close associate, adverse media checks.
*   monitoring of the Business Relationship.

The CDD measures specified above must be applied before establishing the Business Relationship or performing transaction. The exact instruction for application standard due diligence measures is provided in the Guidelines.

Application of Enhanced Due Diligence Measures (level 3)

In addition to standard due diligence measures, the Company applies enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures in order to manage and mitigate an established risk of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the case where the risk is established to be higher than usual. The Company always applies EDD measures, when:

*   the Customer's risk profile indicates high risk level of ML / TF;
*   upon identification of the Customer or verification of submitted information, there are doubts as to the truthfulness of the submitted data, authenticity of the documents or identification of the Beneficial Owner; • where cross-border correspondent relationships are commenced with the Customer, which is financial institution of Third Country;
*   in the case of performance of transaction or Business Relationship with the PEP, the family member of thePEP or a person known to be the close associate of the PEP;

When applying EDD measures, where transactions or Business Relationships are carried out with the PEP, the family member of the PEP or a person known to be the close associate of the PEP, the Company must apply the following measures:

*   obtain approval from the CEO before establishing Business Relationship with such Customer or continuing the Business Relationship with the Customer when he or she becomes a PEP; • take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds that are involved in the Business Relationship or transaction;
*   perform ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship with the Customer by increasing the number and timing of controls applied, and selecting patterns of transactions that need further examination.

*   registration certificate of the relevant register; or
*   a document equivalent with an aforementioned documents or relevant documents of establishment of the Customer.

The Company verifies the correctness of the Customer's data specified above, using information originating from a credible and independent source for that purpose. Where the Company has access to the relevant register of legal entities, the submission of the documents specified above do not need to be demanded from the Customer. The identity of legal entity and the right of legal entity's representation can be verified on the basis of a document specified above, which has been authenticated by a notary or certified by a notary or officially, or on the basis of other information originating from a credible and independent source, including means of electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, thereby using at least two different sources for verification of data in such an event. The identification of the Customer's representative and their right of representation The representative of the Customer shall be identified as the Customer, who is a natural person in accordance with these Guidelines. The Company must also identify and verify the nature and scope of the right of representation of the Customer. The name, date of issue and name of issuer of the document that serves as a basis for the right of representation must be ascertained and retained, except in case, when the right of representation was verified using information originating from the relevant register. The Company must observe the conditions of the right of representation granted to the legal entity's representatives and provide services only within the scope of the right of representation. The authorization has to be in line with the requirements of the Lithuanian Civil Code. The authorization issued abroad has tobe legalized or bear an Apostille. In case the right of representation of the Customer (legal person) is evident from the registry extract, Articles of Association or equivalent documents evidencing the identity of the Customer (legal person), a separate document of authorization (e.g. a Power of Attorney) should not be required. The identification of the Customer's Beneficial Owner The Company must identify the Beneficial Owner of the Customer and take measures to verify the identity of the Beneficial Owner to the extent that allows the Company to make sure that they know who the Beneficial Owner is. The Company collects the following data regarding the Customer's Beneficial Owner(s):

*   personal number;
*   citizenship.

The Company shall request from the Customer information to the Customer's Beneficial Owner (e. g. providing the Customer with an opportunity to specify their Beneficial Owner when collecting data about the Customer). The Company doesn´t establish the Business Relationship, if the Customer, who is a natural person has Beneficial Owner who is not the same person as the Customer. The Beneficial Owner of a legal entity is identified in stages where the obliged entity proceeds to each subsequent stage if the Beneficial Owner of the legal entity cannot be determined in the case of the previous stage. The stages are as follows:

*   is it possible to identify, in respect of the Customer that is a legal entity or a person participating in the transaction, the natural person or persons who actually ultimately control the legal entity or exercise influence or control over it in any other manner, irrespective of the size of the shares, voting rights or ownership rights or its direct or indirect nature;
*   whether the Customer that is a legal entity or the person participating in the transaction has a natural person or persons who own or control the legal entity via direct or indirect shareholding. Family connections and contractual connections must also be taken into account here;
*   who is the natural person in senior management , who must be defined as the Beneficial Owner, as a result of execution of the previous two stages have not made it possible for the obliged entity to identify the Beneficial Owner.

The Company shall apply reasonable measures to verify the accuracy of the information established on the basis of statements or a handwritten document (e.g. by making inquiries in the relevant registers), requiring the submission of the legal entity's annual report or other relevant document. If the Company has doubts about the accuracy or completeness of the relevant information, the Company shall verify the information provided from publicly available sources and, if necessary, request additional information from the Customer. Where the Company establishes the Business Relationship with the Customer whose information on Beneficial Owners must, in accordance with the legislation of EEA´s state, be submitted to the state or be registered there, the Company shall obtain a relevant registration certificate or registry extract upon identification of the Customer´s Beneficial Owner. Use of the Information System of Legal Entities Participants When identifying a Beneficial Owner, the Company must additionally use the Information System of Legal Entities Participants (JADIS) from which to obtain data on Beneficial Owners of the Customer and shall have the right to use other state information systems and registers in which data on the participants of legal persons are accumulated. JADIS can be accessed through the Lithuanian State Enterprise Centre of Registers’ (SECR) via the relevant application. The application may be submitted:

*   electronically through the user self-service system of the Centre of Registers;
*   by e-mail info@registrucentras.lt which should be signed by e-signature;

*   collected at the Client Service Offices of the Centre of Registers;
*   received by post to the address indicated by the client.

Upon the determination of the discrepancy between the information on the Beneficial Owners of the Customer that is a legal person available in JADIS and the information on the Beneficial Owners of the same customer available to them, notify the Customer thereof and propose to provide accurate information on its Beneficial Owners to the data processor of JADIS. The Company shall not enter into a Business Relationship or execute a transaction (except for monetary operations or transactions concluded and/or executed in the course of a Business Relationship), when the information on the Beneficial Owners of the Customer that is a legal person is not provided in JADIS or when the information on the Beneficial Owners of the Customer that is a legal person, provided in JADIS, is incorrect. Political Exposed Person's identification The Company shall take measures to ascertain whether the Customer, the Beneficial Owner of the Customer or the representative of this Customer is a PEP, their family member or close associate or if the Customer has become such a person. The Company shall request from the Customer information to identify if the Customer is a PEP, their family member or close associate (e. g. providing the Customer with an opportunity to specify the relevant information when collecting data about the Customer). The Company shall verify the data received from the Customer by making inquiries in relevant databases or public databases or making inquiries or verifying data on the websites of the relevant supervisory authorities or institutions of the country in which the Customer has place of residence or seat.

The Company shall identify close associates and family members of PEPs only if their connection with PEP is known to the public or if the Company has reason to believe that such a connection exists. Where the Customer who is a PEP no longer performs important public functions placed upon them, the Company shall at least within 12 months take into account the risks that remain related to the Customer and apply relevant and risk sensitivity-based measures as long as it is certain that the risks characteristic of PEPs no longer exist in the case of the Customer. Identification of the purpose and nature of the business relationship or transaction The Company shall understand the purpose and nature of the establishing Business Relationship or performing transaction. Regarding the services provided, the Company may request from the Customer the following information for understanding the purpose and nature of the Business Relationship or transaction:

*   whether the Customer will use the services of the Firm for their own needs or will represent the interests of another person;
*   contact information;
*   information on the registered address and actual living address of the Customer;
*   the estimated transactions turnover with the Company per calendar year;
*   the estimated source of funds used in the Business Relationship or transaction;
*   if the Business Relationship or transaction is related to the Customer´s performance of economic or professional activities and which activities they are;
*   information on the source of funds related to the Business Relationship or transaction, if amount of transactions (incl. expected amount) exceeds established limit.

The Company shall apply additional measures and collect additional information to identify the purpose and nature of the Business Relationship or an Occasional Transaction in cases where:

*   there is a situation that refers to high value or is unusual and/or
*   where the risk and/or risk profile associated with the Customer and the nature of the Business Relationship gives reason for the performance of additional actions in order to be able to appropriately monitor to Business Relationship later.

If the Customer is a legal entity, in addition to aforementioned the Company shall identify the Customer´s area of activity, where the Company shall understand what the Customer deals with and intends to deal within the course of the Business Relationship and how this corresponds to the purpose and nature of the Business Relationship in general and whether it is reasonable, understandable and plausible. The area of activity must fit into the experience profile of the Customer’s representative (or key persons) and/or the Beneficial Owner. Thus, the Company has to identify where the representative’s and/or Beneficial Owner’s capacity, capability, skills and knowledge (experience in general) comes from in order to operate in this area of activity, with these business volumes and with these main business partners. Monitoring of the business relationship The Company shall monitor established Business Relationships where the following ongoing due diligence (ODD) measures are implemented:

*   ensuring that the documents, data, or information collected in the course of the application of due diligence measures are updated regularly and in the case of trigger events, i.e., primarily the data concerning the Customer, their representative (incl. the right of representation) and Beneficial Owner as well as the purpose and nature of the Business Relationship;
*   ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship, which covers transactions carried out in the business relationship to ensure that the transactions correspond to the Company’s knowledge of the Customer, their activities and risk profile;
*   identification of the source and origin of funds used in the transaction(s).

The Company shall regularly check and update the documents, data and information collected within the course of the implementation of CDD measures and update the Customer´s risk profile. The regularity of the checks and update must be based on the risk profile of the Customer and the checks must take place at least:

*   once semi-annually for the high-risk profile Customer;
*   once annually for the medium-risk profile Customer;
*   once every two years for the low-risk profile Customer.

The collected documents, data and information must also be checked if an event has occurred which indicates the need to update the collected documents, data and information. In the course of the ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship, the Company shall monitor the transactions concluded during the Business Relationship in such a manner that the latter can determine whether the transactions to be concluded correspond to the information previously known about the Customer (i.e., what the customer declared upon the establishment of the Business Relationship or what has become known in the course of the Business Relationship). The Company shall also monitor the Business Relationship to ascertain the Customer's activities or facts that indicate criminal activities, Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing or the relation of which to Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing is probable, incl. complicated, high-value and unusual transactions and transaction patterns that do not have any reasonable or obvious economic or legitimate purpose or that are uncharacteristic of the specific features of the business in question. In the course of the Business Relationship, the Company shall constantly assess the changes in the Customer’s activities and assess whether these changes may increase the risk level associated with the Customer and the Business Relationship, giving rise to the need to apply EDD measures. In the course of the ongoing monitoring of the Business Relationship, the Company applies the following measures:

*   screening i.e., monitoring transactions in real-time;
*   monitoring i.e., analyzing transactions later.

The objective of screening is to identify:

*   suspicious and unusual transactions and transaction patterns;
*   transactions exceeding the provided thresholds;
*   politically exposed persons and circumstances regarding Sanctions.
*   potential adverse media about the Client available in open sources.

The screening of the transactions is performed automatically and includes the following measures:

*   established thresholds for the Customer´s transactions, depending on the Customer´s risk profile and the estimated transactions turnover declared by the Customer;
*   the scoring of Virtual Currency wallets where the Virtual Currency shall be sent in accordance with the Customer´s order;
*   the scoring of Virtual Currency wallets from which the Virtual Currency is received.

If the Customer gives order for transaction which exceeds the threshold established or for transaction to the Virtual Currency wallet with high-risk score (e.g. wallets related to fraud, crime, etc.), the transaction shall be manually approved by the Employee, who shall assess, before the approval, the necessity to apply any additional CDD measures (e. g. applying EDD measures, asking source and origin of funds or asking additional information regarding the transaction). When monitoring transactions the Employee shall assess transaction with a view to detect activities and transactions that:

*   deviate from what there is reason to expect based on the CDD measures performed, the services provided, the information provided by the Customer and other circumstances (e.g. exceeding estimated transactions turnover, Virtual Currency sending each time to new Virtual Currency wallet, volume of transactions exceeding limit);
*   without deviating according to previous clause, may be assumed to be part of a Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing;
*   may affect the Customer´s risk profile score.

In the case, where the aforementioned fact is detected, the Employee shall notify MLRO and postpone any transaction of the Customer until MLRO´s decision regarding this. In addition to aforementioned, the MLRO shall review the Company´s transaction regularly (at least once per week) to ensure that:

*   the Company´s Employees properly performed the aforementioned obligations;
*   there are no transactions and transaction patterns that are complicated, high-value and unusual and that have no reasonable or obvious economic or legitimate purpose or are uncharacteristic of the specific features.

The Company identifies the source and origin of the funds used in transaction(s) if necessary. The need to identify the source and origin of funds depends on the Customer’s previous activities as well as other known information. Thereby the identification of the source and origin of the funds used in transaction shall be performed in the following cases:

*   the transactions exceed the limits established by the Company;
*   the transactions do not correspond to the information previously known about the Customer;
*   the Company wants to or should reasonably consider it necessary to assess whether the transactions correspond to the information previously known about the Customer;
*   the Company suspects that the transactions indicate criminal activities, Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing or that the relation of transactions to Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing is probable, incl. complicated, high-value and unusual transactions and transaction patterns that do not have any reasonable or obvious economic or legitimate purpose or are uncharacteristic of the specific features of the business in question.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS
--------------------------------

Upon the entry into force, amendment or termination of Sanctions, the Company shall verify whether the Customer, their Beneficial Owner or a person who is planning to have the Business Relationship or transaction with them is a subject of Sanctions. If the Company identifies a person who is a subject of Sanctions or that the transaction intended or carried out by them is in breach of Sanctions, the Company shall apply Sanctions and inform the FCIS thereof within 3 hours. Procedure for identifying the subject of Sanctions and a transaction violating Sanctions The Company shall use at least the following sources (databases) to verify the Customer´s relation to Sanctions:

*   A consolidated list of EU sanctions;
*   A consolidated list of United Nations sanctions.

In addition to aforementioned sources, the Company may use any other sources by the decision of the Employee who is applying CDD measures. To verify that the persons’ names resulting from the inquiry arete same as the persons listed in a notification containing Sanction(s), their personal data shall be used, the main characteristics of which are, for a legal entity, its name or trademark, registry code or registration date, and for a natural person, their name and personal identification or date of birth. In order to establish the identity of the persons specified in the relevant legal act or notice being the same as those identified as are sult of the inquiry from databases, the Company must analyze the names of the persons found as a result of the inquiry based on the possible effect of factors distorting personal data (e. g. transcribing foreign names, different order of words, substitution of diacritics or double letters etc.). The Company shall perform above mentioned verification on an ongoing basis in the course of an established Business Relationship. The frequency of the ongoing verifications depends on the Customer’s risk profile:

*   once per week for the high-risk profile Customer;
*   once per month for the medium-risk profile Customer;
*   once per quarter for the low-risk profile Customer.

If the Employee has doubts that a person is a subject of Sanctions, the Employee shall immediately notify the MLRO or the CEO. In this case the MLRO or the CEO shall decide whether to ask or acquire additional data from the person or notify the FCIS immediately of their suspicion. The Company shall primarily acquire additional information on their own about the person who is in Business Relationship or is performing a transaction with them, as well as the person intending to establish the Business Relationship, perform a transaction or an act with them, preferring information from a credible and independent source. If, for some reason, such information is not available, the Company shall ask the person who is in the Business Relationship or is performing a transaction or an act with them, as well as the person intending to establish a Business Relationship, perform a transaction or an act with them, whether the information is from a credible and independent source and assess the answer. Actions when identifying the Sanctions subject or a transaction violating Sanctions If the Employee of the Company becomes aware that the Customer which is in Business Relationship or is performing a transaction with the Company, as well as a person intending to establish the Business Relationship or to perform a transaction with the Company, is the subject of Sanctions, the Employee shall immediately notify the MLRO or the CEO, about the identification of the subject of Sanctions, of the doubt thereof and of the measures taken. The MLRO or the CEO shall refuse to conclude a transaction or proceeding, shall take measures provided for in the act on the imposition or implementation of the Sanctions and shall notify immediately the FCIS of their doubts and of the measures taken. When identifying the subject of the Sanctions, it is necessary to identify the measures that are taken to Sanction this person. These measures are described in the legal act implementing the Sanctions, therefore it is necessary to identify the exact sanction what is implemented against the person to ensure legal and proper application of measures.

*   the Customer who is a natural person behind whom is another, actually benefiting person, wants to establish the Business Relationship (suspicion that a person acting as a front is used);
